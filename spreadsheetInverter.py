# Solution to Practice Project "Spreadsheet Cell Inverter"
# from "Automate The Boring Stuff", by Al Sweigart,
# Chapter 12.
#
# "Write a program to invert the row and column of the cells 
# in the spreadsheet. For example, the value at row 5, column 
# 3 will be at row 3, column 5 (and vice versa). This should be 
# done for all cells in the spreadsheet.
# 
# You can write this program by using nested for loops to read 
# in the spreadsheetâ€™s data into a list of lists data structure. 
# This data structure could have sheetData[x][y] for the cell at 
# column x and row y. Then, when writing out the new spreadsheet, 
# use sheetData[y][x] for the cell at column x and row y."
